        <p class="first" >This place is disney land located on Japan. I went there when I was in the elementary school. Tha weather was really hot but there are lots of people who visited there. There are different kinds of rides and impressive buildings and castles. My favotire dizney character is Mickey Mouse. Because of my preference, I bought a t-shirt that has a mickey mouse in the center.</p>

        <p class="second"> This statue is located on Singapore. Its name is Merlion. It is really famojus landmark in the world. I went here when I was in the elemnetary school. There are lots of people. However, I tried my best to take a picture besides Merlion. After I looked around the statue, I went to the souvenir store with my family. This place was really great and beautiful. As shown in the picture, if you go there at night, you might see a beutiful view of Singapore. </p>
